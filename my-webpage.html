                        Located between France and the Mediterranean, Monaco has become a well-known residence for the
                        super
                        wealthy. It is one of the smallest countries in the world, with about 40,000 residents – but has
                        a
                        wealth per capita of $2.1 million.

                        Many of those residents (about 2,700) are multimillionaires. The fact that it one of the only
                        countries in the world with no income tax helps to attract wealthy individuals. It also serves
                        as an
                        offshore center for Europe, drawing many high-earning financiers.
                        Hedge funds based in Monaco could gain from investment by wealthy families in the principality,
                        who
                        have up to €400bn of capital at their disposal according to asset managers.

                        At a roundtable hosted by media provider Opalesque last month, asset managers said that between
                        €300bn and €400bn is controlled by family offices in Monaco, and indicated that there is a
                        substantial demand for access to hedge funds.

                <p>The museum was founded in 1825, the first in the country. It has been on its present site

                <p> After a very lengthy week or a month, one needs to unwind or even go a break, thus I
                    chose Long street. <br>
                    The Pink Tree Mosque is the second oldest mosque in South Africa. It was erected in a
                    building dating back to 1777, but is in fact a "landar", a place used for worship - not
                    a real mosque. The mosque was so named because of the two palm trees that used to grow
                    on the pavement outside.<br>
                    The Victorian-styled Carnival Court used to be where the young up-and-coming business
                    men would keep their apartments. From the detailed wrought-iron balcony, you can watch
                    the world go by up and down Long Street. </p>
